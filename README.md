## What's up?

I'm Chaitanya, a 20-year-old in my second year of B.Tech Robotics and Automation at K.K. Wagh, Nashik. Basically, I'm learning how to make cool robots and stuff.

Right now, I've got some basic experience with:

-   **Python:** Used it for a bunch of things, including some robotics-related projects.
-   **ROS:** Played around with it for robot control and simulation.
-   **ANN:** Started learning about Artificial Neural Networks.
-   **Kinematics:** Figuring out how robot arms move.
-   **Computer Graphics:** Did some work with 3D stuff.
-   **CAD:** Can design basic models.

## What I'm aiming for

Eventually, I want to become a software developer. Robotics software sounds pretty awesome, so that's kinda the direction I'm leaning in right now, but I'm open to other things too.

## My current skills in a nutshell:

-   **Coding:** Python
-   **Robotics Stuff:** ROS, Kinematics
-   **AI/ML:** ANN and Fuzzy Systems 
-   **Design:** CAD (Fusion 360, BricsCAD, Eagle), Computer Graphics
-   **Other:** Some basic ML and control systems knowledge.

## What I'm currently digging into:

-   Getting better at Python for robotics.
-   Learning more about ROS and how to do cooler things with it.
-   Exploring more about AI and how it can be used in robots (like computer vision).
-   Improving my robot simulation skills.

## What's next?

I'm planning to:

-   Try contributing to some open-source robotics projects.
-   Build some personal projects to show what I can do.
-   Keep learning new things through online courses and stuff.
-   Maybe look for an internship sometime.
